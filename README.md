# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms Repository**! ðŸš€ This repository is a comprehensive collection of fundamental machine-learning algorithms implemented with the help  of Python.

**1. Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled data, where the input-output mapping is known. The goal is to predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

Examples of Algorithms:
1) Linear Regression:
Used for predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, stock prices).
Fits a linear relationship between input features and the output.

2) Logistic Regression:
Used for binary classification (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails).
Outputs probabilities to predict categorical outcomes.

3)Decision Trees:
Breaks the data into smaller subsets based on decision rules.
Easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.

4)Random Forest:
An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their results.
Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy.

5)Support Vector Machines (SVM):
Finds a hyperplane to separate data into classes.
Effective for high-dimensional spaces and complex boundaries.

6)Neural Networks:
Composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that mimic the human brain.
Highly effective for image recognition, natural language processing, etc.
