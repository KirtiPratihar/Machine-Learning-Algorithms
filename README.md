# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms Repository! ðŸš€ This repository is a comprehensive collection of fundamental machine-learning algorithms implemented in Python.

**1. Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled data, where the input-output mapping is known. The goal is to predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

Examples of Algorithms:
1) Linear Regression:
Used for predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, stock prices).
Fits a linear relationship between input features and the output.

2) Logistic Regression:
Used for binary classification (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails).
Outputs probabilities to predict categorical outcomes.

3)Decision Trees:
Breaks the data into smaller subsets based on decision rules.
Easy to interpret but prone to overfitting.

4)Random Forest:
An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their results.
Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy.

5)Support Vector Machines (SVM):
Finds a hyperplane to separate data into classes.
Effective for high-dimensional spaces and complex boundaries.

6)Neural Networks:
Composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that mimic the human brain.
Highly effective for image recognition, natural language processing, etc.

**2. Unsupervised Learning**
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, where the system tries to find hidden patterns or structure.

Examples of Algorithms:
1)K-Means Clustering:
Groups data points into clusters based on similarity.
Widely used for market segmentation, document clustering, etc.

2)Hierarchical Clustering:
Creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) for grouping data.
Useful for visualizing relationships between clusters.

3)Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining important information.
Often used for data visualization and noise reduction.

4)DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):
Identifies clusters based on density.
Handles noise and outliers well.
